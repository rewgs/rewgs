Hey there! I'm Alex Ruger, programmer and musician.

I believe that making music on a computer has a lot of room for improvement, and that utilizing the open source tools and protocols that made the internet great in the first place will provide at least *part* of the path that'll get us there.

I work for composer [Bear McCreary](https://bearmccreary.com/) and his production company [Sparks & Shadows](https://sparksandshadows.com/), doing everything from writing internal tools, automating our music production pipeline, building and maintaining our servers and other infrastructure, web development, audio plugin and sample library development, and documentating all of it.

<!-- I have a few projects of my own in the works: -->
<!-- * [`daws`](https://github.com/rewgs/daws): A Go package for working with any and all DAW to the maximum extent that the DAW offers. Still very much in progress. -->
<!-- * [`Reaify`](https://github.com/rewgs/reaify): A Lua library for the Reaper API intended to make it feel a touch more "batteries included." -->
<!-- * `ReaWrite`: Generates a Python wrapper for the Reaper API from its source. -->
<!-- * `ReaConform`: Automates conforming cues to new picture. -->
<!-- * `Cue Queue`: A cross-platform, DAW-agnostic solution for automated stem-printing. Utilizes `daws` under the hood. -->
<!-- * `DAW Report`: A crowd-sourced database for DAW/plugin/OS/etc version compatability and stability reports. -->
<!-- * `Sideman`: A companion app for Digital Performer. Utilizes `daws` under the hood. -->

I'm also a freelance technical consultant, primarily serving composers, music editors, and anyone else who works in audio and needs some help.
